PosturePal – AI-Powered Desk Posture Detection (MERN + Python ML Model)

PosturePal is an AI-based posture monitoring application built using the MERN stack integrated with a Python machine learning model. The system analyzes a user’s live webcam feed while they are working on a laptop or desktop and detects whether their posture is correct or slouched.

This project was developed with the help of Mohammed Mubashir Uddin Faraz.

🔍 Core Features

🧠 ML Model (97% Accuracy): Trained using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe/TensorFlow to detect upper-body posture from webcam input.

🌐 MERN Stack Integration:

React frontend streaming live webcam footage

Node.js + Express backend communicating with Python

MongoDB storing posture alerts and user data

⚠️ Real-Time Posture Alerts: Warns users when slouching or leaning forward for too long.

📊 Analytics Dashboard: Logs posture warnings and shows user-wise statistics.

🔒 Secure Authentication: JWT/Clerk/Firebase (optional based on project setup).

🏗️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB

Machine Learning: Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe/TensorFlow, NumPy

Integration: Child process / Flask API / Socket bridge (depending on your implementation)

📈 Use-Case

Perfect for students, remote employees, gamers, and anyone working long hours on a computer. Helps improve ergonomics and reduce back/neck strain.
